# `0.47.0`

- Settings view page

# `0.46.0`

- `my-iot` now accepts multiple settings files. They're concatenated and the result is parsed as if it was a single TOML file.
- `Telegram` and `Solar` secrets have been moved into the separate `secrets` section, it means that from now on you can split secrets and non-secrets between different TOML files.

# `0.45.0`

Service intercommunication via "fake" messages doesn't play that nice. However, it was mainly meant to work with the old `Automator`, which is now replaced with `Lua`. Thus, I remove this functionality and leave `Write` messages only to actually change existing sensor value. Fake sensors become discouraged since now.

`Telegram` service won't listen to `Write` messages anymore. Use service methods from Lua instead.

**All sensors and readings will be dropped again.** Sensor primary and foreign keys have been changed to [SeaHash](https://ticki.github.io/blog/seahash-explained/)-ed sensor IDs. This allowed removing the dependency on auto-generated primary keys.

Settings file is now specified as an optional positional argument: `my-iot my-iot.toml`.

**`Nest` service has been removed due to the Google migration.**

Switched to [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/).

# `0.44.0`

Unified sensor IDs by changing `my-iot::*` to `my_iot::*`.

`Lua` service gets the new settings, `filter_sensor_ids` and `skip_sensor_ids`, to simplify filtering (out) messages that will be passed to `onMessage`.

# `0.43.0`

This release removes the old `Automator` in favour of the new `Lua` service.

Also, I'm removing the automatic `*::update` and `*::change` events, because they require additional database queries to be executed on each event. If needed, similar functionality can be implemented in Lua. See, for example, the recipe to send new Nest camera animations to Telegram.

`Service` trait is re-introduced to simplify service instantiation.

New `Solar` service is introduced to emit durations before and after sunset and sunrise.
